# `/src/server/common`

## Where am I?
This is where common backend code goes!

## What goes here?
- Functions and classes that are both
  - common to multiple places
  - not associated with a particular model
- Common middleware 

## What doesn't?
- Middleware that is only used for a particular model (that goes in `/routes`)
